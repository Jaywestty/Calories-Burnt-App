## Calories Burnt App
### Project Overview
This project is a web application designed to predict calories burnt based on various user inputs. It leverages a machine learning model to provide estimations, making it a useful tool for fitness tracking and health management.

### Features
- Calorie Prediction: Predicts calories burnt based on user-provided data.
- User Input Parameters: Takes into account parameters such as gender, age, height, weight, exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature.
- Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a supervised learning model (likely a Random Forest Regressor, based on similar projects) trained on a dataset to ensure accurate predictions.
- User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive web interface for easy data input and result display.

### Technologies Used
- Python: The core programming language for the application logic and machine learning model.
- Jupyter Notebook: Likely used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- Streamlit (Potential): Based on similar projects, Streamlit could be used for creating the web application interface.
- Scikit-learn (Potential): For implementing the machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest Regressor).
- Pandas & NumPy (Potential): For data manipulation and analysis.
