## Calories Burnt App
### Project Overview
This project is a web application designed to predict calories burnt based on various user inputs. It leverages a machine learning model to provide estimations, making it a useful tool for fitness tracking and health management.

### Features
- Calorie Prediction: Predicts calories burnt based on user-provided data.
- User Input Parameters: Takes into account parameters such as gender, age, height, weight, exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature.
- Machine Learning Model: Utilises a supervised learning model trained on a dataset to ensure accurate predictions.
- User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive web interface for easy data input and result display.

### Technologies Used
- Python: The core programming language for the application logic and machine learning model.
- Jupyter Notebook: Likely used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- Flask : Flask was used for creating the web application interface.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing the machine learning model.
- Pandas & NumPy : For data manipulation and analysis.
